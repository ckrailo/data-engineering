# Living Social Software Challenge
## Setup
The app is a standard, scaffolded Rails app with a few tweaks.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Jump into the project directory.
3. If you have RVM or similar, the .ruby-version and .ruby-gemset files should work some magic for you. Otherwise, make sure you have ruby-2.1.2 installed (although this should work with earlier versions).
4. bundle install
5. rails s
6. Point browser to localhost:3000
